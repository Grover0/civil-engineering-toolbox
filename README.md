If you want to request application, you can 
<a href="https://github.com/dukenmarga/civil-engineering-toolbox/issues/
new?title=Application%20Request:%20_application_name_" target="_blank">
create a new issue </a> and describe your application.
You can send link or reference to the description, algorithm, picture, code, and 
sample calculation of requested application so I can 
review it first before creating it.
Application must be as general as possible and be used by most of civil
engineers.

## Linux
Due to many variant of Linux distribution, here I will summarize steps to install
civil-engineering-toolbox. I believe that you had already able to use your
software manager, either by GUI (graphical user interface) or command line from
terminal. If your repository doesn't have package below, you can download them
manually, extract them, and then install it by invoking `python setup.py install`
from command line in that extracted directory.
Ensure you have installed Python setuptools before using the command.
